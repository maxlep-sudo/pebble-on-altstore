# Pebble-on-AltStore

Pebble-on-AltStore is an open-source companion app for Pebble smartwatches, designed for iOS devices and intended for sideloading via AltStore. This project aims to provide Pebble users with a simple way to regain watch connectivity, notifications, and watch management on modern iPhones—even after the official Pebble app has been removed from the App Store.

## Features

- Pair and manage Pebble watches on iOS
- Send notifications and alerts to Pebble
- Install watchfaces and apps from the phone
- Sync health and activity data (planned)
- Open-source and privacy-respecting
- Easy sideloading via AltStore
